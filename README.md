*This is version lim(n->infinity) 0.0...(n zeroes here)...1.*

**In the short term, fysnthesizer will be a Python console application that takes in a custom-format music file, applies rudimentary sound processing and generates a WAV file.**

--------
*QUICK DESCRIPTION HERE FOR THE CUSTOM MUSIC FILE FORMAT*
--------

Version 1.0 planned to be implemented **by the start of Summer 2019**, and will be like described below.

**fsynthesizer is (going to become) a program that functions quite like a typical synthesizer.**
It will be a GUI application that allows real-time recording (via a normal or MIDI keyboard) and sound processing. MIDI import will be supported. The user will create their own envelopes, signal shapes, harmonics, sound effects and so on. They will then also be able to save their custom effects. Most widely used music file extensions will be supported in generating an output file.
